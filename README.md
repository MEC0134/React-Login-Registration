### This is a simple React app that you can use as a starting point for your projects. It includes basic routing and common components such as Header, Footer, Home, Register, and Login.

## Getting Started

To use this React app in your own project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Replace the contents of your project's `App.jsx` file with the following code:

   ```jsx
   import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
   import React from "react";
   import Footer from "./components/Footer";
   import Header from "./components/Header";
   import Home from "./components/Home";
   import Register from "./components/Register";
   import Login from "./components/Login";

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <Header />
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
           <Route path="Register" element={<Register />} />
           <Route path="Login" element={<Login />} />
         </Routes>
         <Footer />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

4. Make sure you have React Router installed in your project. If not, you can install it by running the following command:

   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

5. Start your development server by running the following command:

   ```
